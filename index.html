    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a passionate and driven student with a strong foundation in programming, data management, and statistical analysis. My academic journey has equipped me with hands-on experience in languages like Python, Java, C++, and SQL, alongside a solid understanding of database systems and networking.

        I'm eager to apply my analytical skills to uncover insights from data, make data-driven decisions, and solve real-world problems. My experience in building projects, such as Employee Performance Analysis, has honed my ability to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data effectively.
        I've also made projects like reminder notification using python and personal portfolio website using html and css. I thrive on tackling new challenges and pushing the boundaries of my knowledge.
